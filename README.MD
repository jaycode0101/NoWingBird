# Galaxy Nowingbird

Galaxy Nowingbird is a browser-based game that gives a cosmic twist to classic arcade-style gameplay. Guide your futuristic bird through a dynamic, obstacle-filled galaxy while enjoying smooth physics, vibrant visuals, and responsive audio controls.

## Features

- **Cosmic Gameplay:**  
  Control your bird by clicking or pressing the Spacebar to navigate through randomly generated obstacles in a starry, animated background.
  
- **Live Adjustments:**  
  Real-time settings adjustments for game speed, gravity, pipe speed, pipe frequency, and gap size are applied immediately during gameplay.
  
- **Audio Control:**  
  Use the in-game mute button (displayed as ðŸ”Š or ðŸ”‡) to switch the background music on or off during live gameplay.
  
- **High Score Tracking:**  
  Your best score is automatically saved and displayed, encouraging you to improve your performance.

- **Fullscreen Mode:**  
  Enjoy an immersive experience with the fullscreen toggle available on the game over screen.

## Mathematical Concepts in the Game

The gameâ€™s smooth animations and physics are driven by several mathematical principles:

- **Physics and Motion:**  
  The birdâ€™s movement is influenced by gravity, which is applied as a constant acceleration. The birdâ€™s velocity is updated each frame, and its position is recalculated accordingly, resulting in realistic motion.

- **Trigonometry:**  
  The rotation of the bird is calculated based on its velocity. Clamping the rotation value ensures that the bird tilts in a natural manner as it ascends or descends.

- **Geometry:**  
  Visual elements such as the bird, obstacles, stars, and planets are drawn using geometric shapes like ellipses and circles. Gradients (both linear and radial) add depth and dynamic lighting effects.

- **Randomization:**  
  Random number generation (`Math.random()`) sets initial positions, sizes, and movement parameters for stars, planets, comets, and obstacles, ensuring each playthrough is unique.

- **Animation Calculations:**  
  The use of `requestAnimationFrame` combined with periodic mathematical updates (e.g., sine functions for star twinkling) creates smooth and responsive animations.

     It's my first project so I hope you guys will be happy with my first project# NoWingBird
